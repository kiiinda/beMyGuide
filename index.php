     <h3>Teenage Pregnacies</h3>
       <p>Data from Kenya Data and Health Survey (2014) show that 1 in every 5 girls between 15-19 years is either pregnant or already a mother. As of 2019 latest statistics from 
         the Global Childhood Kenya has the third-highest teen pregnancy rates with 82 births per 1,000 births.</p>
         <p>Concurrently, over 13,000 teenage girls drop out of school annually because of pregnancy. (Kenya Data and Health Survey, 2014). Recent media reports show that 449 girls are failing to sit for their final examinations while others write examinations in maternity wards.
          This is a red flag on the girls’ education, health and opportunities not to mention a failure on the society as whole.</p>
          <p>We therefore aim to provide girls with information on how they can best protect themselves. And in the event they do get pregnant,
            we outlined some practices they can learn.
